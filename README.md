There is small easy web editor for OpenServerPanel version 6 (https://ospanel.io/) to add/edit file project.ini
To install make 5 small steps:
1. save files to folder '{ROOT_FOR_OSPanel}\OSPanel\home\osp\'.
2. [optional] if need (usually not need at all), edit file {ROOT_FOR_OSPanel}\OSPanel\home\osp\src\config\config.php
3. restart openserver
4. call http://osp.local
5. enjoy ;-)

P.S. after any saving, please do not forget restart openserver   

Advantages of using:
1. show list of all projects with posibilities search and open project in new browser window
2. view/save option in one click in popup window
3. saving previous vesion of file project.ini in format project.ini.yyyymmdd_hhmmss (as archive of rewrited version), that allows to restore previous version if save incorrect value(s) in new version
